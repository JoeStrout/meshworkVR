// The current version of Unity has some bug where it fails to load the window
// layout, and then gets stuck unable to proceed.  The only working option is
// to quit.  The only work-around I know is to delete the following file.

file.delete "UnityProject/Library/CurrentLayout-default.dwlt"

// Incidentally, if you're curious, this script is written in MiniScript:
// https://miniscript.org

// (This is the same language Meshwork VR will use for extensions.)
