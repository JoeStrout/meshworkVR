# meshworkVR

Meshwork VR is a 3D modeling, texturing, and finishing app for VR platforms (including Oculus Quest).


## Needed Plugins

The project requires several commercial plugins which we (obviously) cannot include in the repo:

- [Paint in 3D](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/painting/paint-in-3d-26286)
- [Wireframe Shader](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/wireframe-shader-181386)
- [Script Inspector 3](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/script-inspector-3-3535)

(That last one is not strictly required, but highly recommended.)
