<h2>Dummiesman's OBJ Importer</h2>
<p>Works during runtime*, and in editor! A couple of code samples are provided in the Samples folder.</p>

<p>You must go to the "Graphics" tab in your project, and add "Standard (Specular Setup)" to the always included shaders. This will make your next build take a while.</p>
